# dotfiles

**Contains some of my prefered customizations for the terminal**

To apply these in your terminal, clone the repository and run the script `dotfiles_setup.sh`  
This will *DELETE* all your default dotfiles with the same name, and create links in the home folder to the given dotfiles in the repo  
Better create a backup first :)

```
git clone https://github.com/AkshatBaranwal/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
sh dotfiles_setup.sh
```

happy coding..
