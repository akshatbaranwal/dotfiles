# dotfiles

**Contains some of my preferred customizations for the terminal**

To apply these in your terminal, clone the repository and run the script `dotfiles_setup.sh`  
This will create a backup of the existing dotfiles and replace them with soft links to the ones in this folder

#### How To Use

```
git clone https://github.com/AkshatBaranwal/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
bash dotfiles_setup.sh install
```

#### Revert To Original

```
bash dotfiles_setup.sh uninstall
```

happy coding..
